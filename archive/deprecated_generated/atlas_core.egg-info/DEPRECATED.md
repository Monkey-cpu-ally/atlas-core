# Deprecated Generated Metadata

This folder contains archived `atlas_core.egg-info` metadata previously tracked
in the repository root.

Reason for archival:
- Generated packaging metadata should be reproducible from `pyproject.toml`.
- Keeping generated metadata in the runtime source root adds noise to audits.

If needed, regenerate locally with a package build/install workflow.
