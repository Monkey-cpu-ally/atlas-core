# 09 — BUILDER ROADMAP

## Document Control
- Program: **Polymath Forge + Atlas Hybrid System**
- Status: Draft v1
- Last Updated: 2026-02-17
- Scope: Sequenced roadmap from doctrine to durable mastery workflows

---

## 1. Roadmap Intent

Deliver a disciplined personal mastery platform in ordered, testable stages:
1. Doctrine stability
2. Learning architecture reliability
3. Artifact and progression integrity
4. Scalable quality and governance

---

## 2. Phase Plan

## Phase 0 — Doctrine Freeze (Foundation)
**Goal:** lock core doctrine and role boundaries  
**Deliverables:**
- master doctrine finalized
- persona role boundaries locked
- safety policy gates explicit
**Exit Criteria:** no unresolved doctrine ambiguities

## Phase 1 — Academy Core (22 Subjects)
**Goal:** publish canonical curriculum architecture  
**Deliverables:**
- subject map with dependencies
- mastery level definitions
- required artifact outputs per subject
**Exit Criteria:** 22-subject model approved and versioned

## Phase 2 — Teaching Reliability
**Goal:** enforce IVY-SIMPLE standard  
**Deliverables:**
- teaching sequence compliance checks
- lesson quality rubric and rejection rules
- teach-back loop integration
**Exit Criteria:** lessons are sequence-complete and auditable

## Phase 3 — Vault Infrastructure
**Goal:** make knowledge and artifacts durable  
**Deliverables:**
- material vault governance
- project artifact lineage and rollback model
- retrieval quality standards
**Exit Criteria:** project memory and artifacts are fully traceable

## Phase 4 — Progression Engine
**Goal:** make progression evidence-based  
**Deliverables:**
- unlock logic
- tests/retest engine
- anti-gaming controls
**Exit Criteria:** advancement requires demonstrated mastery

## Phase 5 — Builder Experience
**Goal:** unify build execution experience  
**Deliverables:**
- tome UI consistency baseline
- clearer build-state transitions
- improved empty states and navigation clarity
**Exit Criteria:** workflow friction reduced without logic drift

## Phase 6 — Optimization and Scaling
**Goal:** improve throughput and quality under load  
**Deliverables:**
- performance tuning
- stronger observability and audit dashboards
- policy incident review process
**Exit Criteria:** stable, measurable operation at target usage

---

## 3. Cross-Phase Constraints

- No bypass of Hermes policy gates
- No cross-project memory contamination
- No unversioned schema or doctrine drift
- No hidden route/contract changes without documentation

---

## 4. Success Metrics

- Subject completion quality (not just completion count)
- Retest-to-pass efficiency trend
- Artifact quality and validation pass rate
- Policy violation prevention effectiveness
- Learner confidence and transfer performance

---

## 5. Risk Register (Top-Level)

1. Scope sprawl without governance checkpoints
2. Over-complex teaching outputs reducing adoption
3. Inconsistent artifact standards across projects
4. Policy erosion under speed pressure

Mitigation: stage gates, review loops, and explicit rollback plans.

---

## 6. Rollback Philosophy

Each phase must be independently reversible:
- document versions are immutable once published
- major shifts require migration notes
- rollback paths are defined before rollout
