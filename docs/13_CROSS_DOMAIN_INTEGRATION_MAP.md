## 1. Purpose

This document defines how all 22 subjects contribute to one engineering-centered platform.  
Every subject is mandatory. No subject is optional, demoted, or excluded.

The map is designed to keep robotics/building focus strong while preserving equal structural importance across all disciplines.
It is the subject-level execution map for **one platform, five expressions**.

## 3. One Platform, Five Expressions Integration Rule

Each subject must support at least one of the five platform expressions:
1. Wearable (Micro)
2. Robotics (Meso)
3. Environmental (Macro)
4. Aerospace (Extreme)
5. Hybrid Convergence

In practice, most subjects support multiple expressions through shared methods, constraints, and validation logic.
