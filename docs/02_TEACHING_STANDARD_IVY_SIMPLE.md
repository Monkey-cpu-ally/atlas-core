# 02 — TEACHING STANDARD (IVY-SIMPLE)

## Document Control
- Standard Name: **IVY-SIMPLE**
- Status: Draft v1
- Last Updated: 2026-02-17
- Scope: Teaching quality standard for Polymath Forge

---

## 1. Purpose

IVY-SIMPLE defines how to teach with:
- **Ivy-level rigor** (correctness, depth, discipline)
- **Simple delivery** (clarity, structure, low cognitive overload)

Hard rule: **PhD backbone / 6th-grade clarity**.
- "PhD backbone" means first-principles correctness, explicit assumptions, and defensible reasoning.
- "6th-grade clarity" means plain-language explanation, step-by-step pacing, and no jargon dependence.

Target outcome: the learner can understand, apply, and explain concepts without jargon dependency.

---

## 2. Core Principles

0. **PhD backbone / 6th-grade clarity is mandatory**
1. Precision over hype
2. Plain language before formal notation
3. One idea per step
4. Every abstract idea gets a concrete anchor
5. No skipped reasoning links
6. Every lesson ends with an executable next step

---

## 3. Mandatory Teaching Sequence

No stage skipping allowed:
1. **Definition**
2. **Physical intuition**
3. **Mathematical core** (when learner-ready)
4. **Real-world example**
5. **Prototype connection**
6. **Risk and failure modes**
7. **Mini build exercise**
8. **Review loop**

---

## 4. Language and Tone Rules

- Sentences should be concise and active.
- Introduce only necessary terms; define each term once.
- Avoid decorative complexity and over-metaphor.
- Explain assumptions explicitly.
- Avoid false certainty; state confidence limits.

---

## 5. Mathematical Depth Ladder

- **Level 1**: arithmetic/ratios/units
- **Level 2**: algebraic relations
- **Level 3**: calculus/statistical reasoning
- **Level 4**: domain-specific formal methods

Learner must demonstrate stability at current level before promotion.

---

## 6. Standard Lesson Template

1. Learning objective (1-2 lines)
2. Prior knowledge check
3. Core explanation (sequence-compliant)
4. Worked example
5. Error analysis example
6. Mini build or simulation prompt
7. Teach-back questions
8. Exit criteria

---

## 7. Persona Collaboration Contract

- **Ajani**: technical skeleton and constraints
- **Minerva**: instructional narrative and simplification
- **Hermes**: correctness/risk/policy review
- **Atlas**: sequencing and final assembly

If conflict occurs, Hermes policy correctness takes priority.

---

## 8. Output Quality Rubric

Each lesson scored 1-5 in:
- Correctness
- Clarity
- Structure compliance
- Transferability (can learner apply)
- Safety/policy alignment

Any score below 3 requires revision before release.

---

## 9. Failure Conditions

A lesson is rejected if it:
- skips sequence stages
- includes unsafe operational content
- provides vague, non-testable guidance
- introduces terms without definition
- omits failure mode discussion for build-relevant topics

---

## 10. Acceptance Criteria

A lesson is accepted only when:
- sequence is complete
- rubric minimum is met
- teach-back answers indicate comprehension
- next action is specific and measurable
- it satisfies the **PhD backbone / 6th-grade clarity** rule
