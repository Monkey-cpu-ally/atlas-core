# 01 — ACADEMY STRUCTURE (22 SUBJECTS)

## Document Control
- Product: **Polymath Forge Academy**
- Status: Draft v1
- Last Updated: 2026-02-17
- Scope: Subject architecture, sequencing, and mastery progression

---

## 1. Objective

Define a stable 22-subject academy that converts broad curiosity into structured, testable, cross-domain mastery.

Design principles:
- Cumulative foundations
- Measurable progression
- Strong transfer between theory and build artifacts
- Safety and ethics embedded, not optional

---

## 2. Academy Tier Model

1. **Tier A — Foundations**
2. **Tier B — Computational Core**
3. **Tier C — Physical and Engineering Core**
4. **Tier D — Integrated Intelligence and Governance**

Progression is sequential by dependency, not by preference alone.

---

## 4. Dependency Rules

- Tier A must be substantially complete before Tier C depth work.
- Subjects 13, 14, 19, and 20 are linked and should be studied as a cluster.
- Subject 22 cannot be unlocked without prior completion of:
  - 05 (uncertainty/statistics)
  - 06 (experimental design)
  - 21 (AI/HCI framing)

---

## 5. Required Outputs Per Subject

Each subject must produce:
1. **Concept Map** (definitions, relationships, assumptions)
2. **Worked Example Set** (at least 3)
3. **Mini Assessment** (objective and open-response)
4. **Applied Artifact** (simulation, design note, or prototype plan)
5. **Teach-Back Brief** (short explanation in plain language)

---

## 6. Mastery Levels

- **L0 — Exposure**: recognizes terms
- **L1 — Comprehension**: explains ideas accurately
- **L2 — Application**: solves bounded problems
- **L3 — Synthesis**: integrates across subjects
- **L4 — Instruction**: teaches and defends approach under review

Promotion requires passing test and artifact gates (defined in Document 08).

## 7. Cross-Subject Integration Tracks

### Track A: Resonance Systems
Subjects: 13, 14, 19, 20, 22

### Track B: Intelligent Builder Stack
Subjects: 07, 08, 09, 11, 18, 21

### Track C: Physical-to-Digital Translation
Subjects: 12, 16, 17, 18, 19

---

## 8. Subject Project Requirement (Minimum 2+ Per Subject)

Every subject must maintain at least **two active anchor projects**.
These are mandatory applied projects used for unlock evidence and retest recovery.

## 9. Governance

- Subject additions/removals require doctrine change review.
- Reordering dependencies requires explicit risk note.
- No silent subject drift from the canonical 22 list.
