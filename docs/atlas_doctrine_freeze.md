# Atlas Doctrine Freeze (Milestone 1)

## Status
- Milestone: 1
- Title: Finalize doctrine, freeze architecture, lock pipeline
- Architecture Frozen: **true**
- Pipeline Locked: **Blueprint -> Build -> Modify**
- Expansion Allowed: **false** (until milestone complete)

## Project Registry Requirement
All Atlas projects must be registered with:
- project name
- category
- academic dependencies
- current phase
- version

## Capability Matrix Lock
Role drift is prevented by locked capability ownership:
- Atlas: routing, memory management, policy enforcement
- Ajani: engineering blueprint generation
- Minerva: teaching explanation and conceptual translation
- Hermes: validation, safety, policy constraints

## Teaching Framework Lock
Teaching must remain in this order:
1. Definition
2. Physical intuition
3. Mathematical core (when ready)
4. Real-world example
5. Prototype connection
6. Risk & failure modes
7. Mini build exercise
8. Review loop

## Operational Boundary
Frontend:
- UI and gateway only
- no reasoning core
- no project memory persistence

Backend:
- reasoning and orchestration
- validation and policy gates
- project memory

Contracts:
- strict JSON schema
- version-tagged outputs
