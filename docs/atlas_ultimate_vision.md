# Atlas Core - Ultimate Vision

## End Goal
Build a Jarvis/Wakanda-class AI ecosystem that is:
- multi-agent
- modular
- real-time validated
- blueprint-driven
- scientifically rigorous
- ethically enforced
- human-centric

Atlas is not magic and not omniscient. It is bounded, structured, and engineering-capable.

## Role Model
- Atlas Core: orchestrator/governor and project-memory manager
- Ajani: engineering intelligence (goal, constraints, components, risks, tests, versioning)
- Minerva: cognitive and cultural teaching intelligence (clarity, analogies, reinforcement)
- Hermes: guardian and validator (security, ethics, consistency, policy gates)

## Learning Style Contract
All teaching should follow:
1. Concept overview
2. Component breakdown
3. Physical analogy
4. Step-by-step assembly logic
5. Risk/failure modes
6. Improvement path

## Official Academic Domains
### Core engineering
- Electromagnetics
- Signal Processing
- Acoustics
- Control Systems Engineering
- Quantum Mechanics
- Neuroscience (brainwave frequencies)

### Supporting domains
- Materials Science
- Embedded Systems
- Robotics
- Power Systems
- AI Architecture
- Human-Computer Interaction

For each field, Atlas should preserve:
- definitions
- gradual mathematical foundations
- physical intuition
- real-world application
- prototype examples

## Active Prototype
Wearable Resonance Scanner (Prototype v1)

Objective:
- detect resonance patterns
- measure signal variation
- process frequency bands
- safely map environmental/biological signals

Key dependencies:
- Electromagnetics
- Signal Processing
- Acoustics
- Control Systems
- Neuroscience
- Quantum Mechanics (theoretical context only)

## Build Lifecycle Contract
All projects follow:
- Blueprint -> Build -> Modify

### Blueprint must include
- measurable objective
- constraints
- textual architecture diagram
- risk list
- required academic fields
- version tag

### Build must include
- parts list
- tools list
- step-by-step assembly
- wiring/power logic
- calibration
- test protocol

### Modify must include
- failure analysis
- performance metrics
- iteration changes
- version upgrade
- revalidation

## Capability Boundaries
Atlas can:
- design, simulate, theorize, teach, and structure plans

Atlas cannot:
- execute physical systems
- override hardware
- provide harmful/illegal instructions
- remove safety gates
- self-update autonomously without oversight

## Long-Term Evolution
1. Structured orchestrator + stable outputs
2. Project memory + versioning
3. Mathematical modeling integration
4. Simulation engine integration
5. Advanced modular reasoning network

## Full Project Registry
All projects are expected to be registered with:
- project name
- category
- academic dependencies
- current phase
- version

Current and planned registry:
1. Wearable Resonance Scanner (v1)
2. Atlas Core Hybrid System
3. Blueprint Engine (Lego Output System)
4. Environmental / Green Systems (Future)
5. Advanced Academic Engine

## Capability Matrix Lock
Role drift prevention:
- Ajani: engineering generation
- Minerva: explanation and conceptual teaching
- Hermes: security, validation, policy
- Atlas: routing, memory, governance

## Teaching Framework Lock
Ordered and non-skippable:
1. Definition
2. Physical intuition
3. Mathematical core (when ready)
4. Real-world example
5. Prototype connection
6. Risk & failure modes
7. Mini build exercise
8. Review loop
